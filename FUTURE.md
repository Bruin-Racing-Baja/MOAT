This branch is for me to do stuff in the car
IDEAS:
Tyler (not as fun but useful)
//TODO
        //MIN/MAX instead of if else
        //Check halls 0/1 when triggered ITS 0
        //Change output from int array to array of pointers
        //Attach to interrupt

Fun:
    Have function see how long it is since its saved, and adjust save threshhold to get it to a certain time
    Change output to be only values and commas, and can save to excel
    Would need to create a fn to cleanly view the data tho
    Run without sd card
