Baja ECVT Settings File
The format should be title:# 
NO SPACE BETWEEN COLON AND NUMBER
All the integers will be set first, then the floats, and anything else after that
The file will skip all the text up until the dollar sign and treat as comment
Not much about this setup is flexible, and it is very annoying to debug, so make sure you dont accidentally change anything
